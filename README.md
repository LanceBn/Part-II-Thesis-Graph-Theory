# Part-II-Thesis-Graph-Theory
Graph theory scripts used in the analysis of neural network topology in cortical cultures, as part of my Cambridge University part II thesis.  

These scripts were used for:
  Validation of repetition number (repNum) in probabilistic thresholding (x2 scripts)
  Calculation of the novel small world coefficient (x1 script)
  Validation of iteration (ITERATIONS) in null model creation (x3 scripts)
  
These scripts contain code modified from that available within the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) to fit our data and to add additional output 
variables important for our analysis.
